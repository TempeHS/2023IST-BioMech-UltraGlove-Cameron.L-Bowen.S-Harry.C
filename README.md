*UltraGlove*
**Description**
The device consists of two components; the gaming glove and the sensor bar. The gaming glove is the key component and it consists of the accelerometer and the gyroscope sensor. The accelerometer and gyroscope detects the tilt of the glove allowing the platformer character to move back and forth on the two dimensional plane while the gesture sensor receives different gesture input from the user to activate different outputs. The sensor bar features the gesture sensor which responds to different gesture inputs.
